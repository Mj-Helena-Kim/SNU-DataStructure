# SNU-DataStructure 2022 Spring
This is the repository for SNU Data Structure 2022 Spring class.

There are 6 homeworks uploaded with skeleton code at the beginning of the semester. (March 18, 2022 16:38 KST)

## Announcement
1. Homeworks should be done by the JAVA programming language.
2. Homeworks are expected to be submitted via ETL.
3. There will be 20 points penalty per day for late submissions.
4. In the case of plagiarism, the HW will be 0 points, and will also affect final grades.
